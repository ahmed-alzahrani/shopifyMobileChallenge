# Shopify Mobile Challenge

A mobile app built as part of my application for the position of Mobile Developer Intern at Shopify for the Summer 2018 semester.

## Problem

1. You're a successful Shopify merchant! Your inventory has grown so much that you can't keep track of them with your fingers anymore. Create a mobile app that displays a list of all the products your store sells. You want to quickly glance at them, so the list should also have the following:

* The product image (just use the first image in the result, if there are any)
* The title of the product
* The description of the product


2. Feeling adventurous? Let's try opening the new screen when you tap on a product in the list. The screen should show detailed information for that product.

3. Wow you are still here. How about we add search capabilities to the app? Let's add a search bar where we can filter our products so we can find them more easily.

## Built With

* [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - Elegant HTTP Networking in Swift
* [AlamofireImage](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireImage) - An image component library for Alamofire
